# STEM.3

An interactive, accessible digital textbook for KS3 learners (ages 11–14). Initial scaffold is a fast, static multi‑page site optimized for clarity, performance, and WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.

## Structure
- Home (`index.html`)
- About (`about.html`)
- Textbook (`textbook/index.html`)
  - Physics (`textbook/physics/index.html`)
  - Engineering Fundamentals (`textbook/engineering-fundamentals/index.html`)
- Labs (placeholder) (`labs/index.html`)
- Contact (`contact.html`)

## Develop
Open `index.html` with any static server (or your editor's live server). All assets are under `assets/`.

## Notes
- Biology, Chemistry, and Maths intentionally omitted per requirements.
- High-contrast palette; avoid text over images to keep text legible.
