      <article class="card">
        <h3>The Engineering Design Cycle</h3>
        <p>Engineers rarely get things perfect the first time. Instead, they follow a cycle and keep improving their ideas:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Define the problem</strong> &mdash; What issue are you solving? Who is affected?</li>
          <li><strong>Identify &amp; research</strong> &mdash; What are the design requirements and limits (budget, time, materials)?</li>
          <li><strong>Brainstorm ideas</strong> &mdash; Generate different solutions, look at existing products for inspiration.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan</strong> &mdash; Sketch designs, choose materials, and write step-by-step build instructions.</li>
          <li><strong>Build a prototype</strong> &mdash; Create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), the simplest working version.</li>
          <li><strong>Test &amp; improve</strong> &mdash; Try it out. What works? What fails?</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback</strong> &mdash; Ask users what they like, what confuses them, and what they would change.</li>
          <li><strong>Iterate</strong> &mdash; Refine the design based on testing and feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate</strong> &mdash; Share the final design and its impact, and plan the next improvements.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="small">This cycle never really ends &mdash; even successful products are updated and improved over time.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Real-world example: Dyson Vacuum</h3>
        <p>James Dyson, founder of Dyson, applied the engineering design cycle to redesign the vacuum cleaner:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem</strong> &mdash; Traditional vacuum bags clogged and lost suction.</li>
          <li><strong>Research</strong> &mdash; He studied industrial cyclone systems that spin dust out of the air using centrifugal force.</li>
          <li><strong>Brainstorm</strong> &mdash; He explored how to adapt cyclone technology for a home vacuum.</li>
          <li><strong>Prototyping &amp; testing</strong> &mdash; He built thousands of prototypes, constantly testing and tweaking.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate</strong> &mdash; The final bagless vacuum changed the market and inspired other companies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">Key message: even world‑changing products start as rough ideas and messy prototypes.</p>

      <h2 id="materials">Materials Matter: Why We Don&rsquo;t Build Bridges with Chocolate</h2>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Material properties</h3>
        <p>Materials are the substances that make up physical objects. They have properties that determine how useful they are in real designs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stress</strong> &mdash; How much internal force a material feels when external forces act on it. Stress helps engineers predict if something will deform or break.</li>
          <li><strong>Strain</strong> &mdash; How much a material actually changes shape (deforms) under stress; the ratio of change in length to original length.</li>
          <li><strong>Elasticity</strong> &mdash; The ability of a material to return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed.</li>
          <li><strong>Toughness</strong> &mdash; How much energy a material can absorb before fracturing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many materials follow <strong>Hooke&rsquo;s law</strong> for small stretches: <strong>F = kx</strong>, where <em>F</em> is force, <em>x</em> is extension, and <em>k</em> is the spring constant (stiffness).</p>
        <p class="small">Engineers use stress, strain, elasticity, and toughness to choose safe, long‑lasting materials.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Why bridges use steel and concrete</h3>
        <p>Bridges must carry heavy loads for decades, often in harsh weather. That&rsquo;s why engineers choose materials like <strong>steel</strong> and <strong>concrete</strong> instead of something weak or brittle, like chocolate.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Steel</strong> &mdash; High strength, good strain tolerance, and strong toughness. Ideal for beams, cables, and reinforcing bars.</li>
          <li><strong>Concrete</strong> &mdash; Very good at handling compressive stress and extremely tough when combined with steel reinforcement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, steel and concrete create structures that can support traffic loads safely for many years.</p>

      <h2 id="bernoulli">Bernoulli&rsquo;s Principle</h2>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Air, pressure, and lift</h3>
        <p>Air might look invisible, but it is a <strong>fluid</strong> with mass, density, and pressure. Bernoulli&rsquo;s principle links the speed of a fluid to its pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Bernoulli&rsquo;s principle:</strong> when the speed of a fluid increases, its pressure (or potential energy) decreases, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>This idea is crucial in aviation. Airplane wings and flaps are shaped and angled to control airflow and pressure, generating <strong>lift</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flaps extend from the wing and tilt downwards during takeoff and landing.</li>
          <li>They slow down airflow over certain parts of the wing and redirect air downwards.</li>
          <li>Changes in speed and direction of the air change pressure, creating extra lift so the plane can leave the ground or land more safely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">Many technologies &mdash; from spray bottles to carburettors &mdash; also use Bernoulli&rsquo;s principle to move fluids efficiently.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Project ideas (preview)</h3>
        <p>This section will bring everything together in larger engineering challenges, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designing and testing a model bridge using limited materials.</li>
          <li>Building a simple wind tunnel or airfoil test rig to explore Bernoulli&rsquo;s principle.</li>
          <li>Creating a product concept and presenting it using the full engineering design cycle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">These project‑based builds will be linked with the AI Tutor and interactive labs to provide feedback and extension tasks.</p>
