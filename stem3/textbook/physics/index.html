      <h2 id="core-concepts">Part 1: Core Concepts in Motion</h2>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Newton&rsquo;s Blueprint: Laws of Motion</h3>
        <p>Newton&rsquo;s three laws link forces to how objects move.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>First Law (Inertia)</strong> &mdash; An object stays at rest or moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless a resultant (unbalanced) force acts on it.</li>
          <li><strong>Second Law</strong> &mdash; The resultant force on an object equals its mass multiplied by its acceleration: <strong>F = m&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;a</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Third Law</strong> &mdash; For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Everyday examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skateboard (First Law)</strong> &mdash; After you push off, friction and air resistance slow you down. If there were no friction or air resistance, the board would keep rolling at a constant speed.</li>
          <li><strong>Shopping trolley (Second Law)</strong> &mdash; An empty trolley (small mass) accelerates quickly with a small push. A full trolley (large mass) needs a bigger force to get the same acceleration.</li>
          <li><strong>Car thrust and air resistance (Third Law)</strong> &mdash; As the engine produces thrust forwards, air pushes back (air resistance). When you lift your foot off the accelerator, thrust drops and the opposing force slows the car.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small"><strong>Try it:</strong> Draw a diagram of a person pushing a loaded trolley. Label all forces (push, weight, normal reaction, friction). Challenge: if the resultant force is 6&nbsp;N and the mass is 3&nbsp;kg, what is the acceleration? <strong>a = F &divide; m</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Energy: The Invisible Currency</h3>
        <p>Energy powers everything around you &mdash; your devices, your home, and your body. It comes in different stores and can be transferred from one form to another.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kinetic energy</strong> &mdash; The energy of movement. Jerry and his dog Bob both have kinetic energy while walking, but Jerry has more because he has more mass at the same speed.</li>
          <li><strong>Gravitational potential energy</strong> &mdash; Energy stored because of height. At the top of a mountain, Jerry and Bob have more gravitational potential energy than at the bottom.</li>
          <li><strong>Thermal energy</strong> &mdash; The energy stored in the movement of particles. In Jerry&rsquo;s campfire, faster-vibrating particles in the hot flames transfer energy to the cooler air and surroundings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">Key idea: energy is never created or destroyed, only transferred or stored in different ways.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Forces &amp; Friction: Pushes, Pulls, and Resultant Force</h3>
        <p>A <strong>force</strong> is a push or pull. Many forces can act at once; the <strong>resultant force</strong> is the single force that has the same effect as all of them together.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forces in the <strong>same direction</strong> add together.</li>
          <li>Forces in <strong>opposite directions</strong> subtract &mdash; the larger minus the smaller gives the resultant, in the direction of the larger force.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the resultant force is <strong>zero</strong>, the object is either stationary or moving at a constant speed. If it is <strong>not zero</strong>, the object accelerates in the direction of the resultant force.</p>
        <p class="small">Example: in a car, thrust must be greater than air resistance to speed up. If they are equal, the car cruises at constant speed.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Gravity</h3>
        <p><strong>Gravity</strong> is the attractive force between masses. It keeps you on the ground, the Moon orbiting Earth, and Earth orbiting the Sun.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anything with mass has gravity, but we only notice it strongly for very massive objects like planets and stars.</li>
          <li>Gravity gets <strong>stronger</strong> with more mass and <strong>weaker</strong> with distance.</li>
          <li>Your <strong>mass</strong> stays the same wherever you go, but your <strong>weight</strong> (force of gravity on you) changes on different planets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">Example: if you have a mass of 70&nbsp;kg, your weight would appear smaller on the Moon and larger on Jupiter because the gravitational field strength is different.</p>
        <p>Gravity also shapes the universe: it pulls gas and dust together to form planets, moons, stars, and even black holes. Around a black hole, gravity is so strong that not even light can escape; the bright ring we see is light bending around it.</p>

        <h3>Normal Force and Tension</h3>
        <h4>Normal force</h4>
        <p>The <strong>normal force</strong> is the support force from a surface, acting at 90&deg; (perpendicular) to it.</p>
        <p>When a box sits on a table, gravity pulls it down. The table pushes up with an equal normal force so the box does not fall through. The surface behaves a bit like a spring: it squashes slightly and pushes back.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always acts <strong>perpendicular</strong> to the surface.</li>
          <li>Exists only when surfaces are in contact.</li>
          <li>Gets larger if the object is heavier and deforms the surface more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Tension</h4>
        <p><strong>Tension</strong> is the pulling force transmitted along ropes, strings, chains, or similar objects.</p>
        <p>In a tug-of-war, every tiny segment of the rope is being pulled from both sides, so each part of the rope is under tension along its length. On the microscopic level, atoms in the rope are stretched from their normal positions, storing potential energy, and trying to pull back &mdash; just like a stretched elastic band.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Friction</h3>
        <p><strong>Friction</strong> is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces sliding, or trying to slide, over each other.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It always acts in the <strong>opposite direction</strong> to movement.</li>
          <li>Rougher surfaces create more friction (e.g., carpet vs. smooth table).</li>
          <li>Friction produces <strong>thermal energy</strong> &mdash; rubbing your hands warms them up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Friction can be helpful (shoes gripping the ground, car brakes stopping a vehicle) or something we want to reduce (oil in bike gears to reduce wear and make motion smoother).</p>

      <h2 id="waves-light-electricity">Part 2: Waves, Sound, Light &amp; Electricity</h2>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Sound Waves: Physics You Can Hear</h3>
        <p>Sound is a <strong>mechanical wave</strong>, which means it needs a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel. That&rsquo;s why sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space.</p>
        <p>Sound waves are <strong>longitudinal</strong> pressure waves: particles vibrate back and forth in the same direction as the energy transfer, creating:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Compressions</strong> &mdash; regions where particles are close together (high pressure).</li>
          <li><strong>Rarefactions</strong> &mdash; regions where particles are spread out (low pressure).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Amplitude</strong> &mdash; size of the pressure change; larger amplitude means a louder sound.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency</strong> (Hz) &mdash; number of waves per second; higher frequency means a higher pitch.</li>
          <li><strong>Wavelength</strong> &mdash; distance between matching points on the wave.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sound travels fastest in <strong>solids</strong>, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases, because particles are closer together in solids.</p>
        <h4>Echolocation</h4>
        <p>Bats and dolphins use <strong>echolocation</strong>. They emit high-frequency sounds (above 20,000&nbsp;Hz &mdash; beyond human hearing) and listen for echoes. By timing how long the echoes take to return and how strong they are, these animals can work out the distance, size, and even movement of objects around them.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Light: The Bending Truth</h3>
        <p>Light is an <strong>electromagnetic wave</strong>. It does not need a medium and can travel through a vacuum at about <strong>3 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> m/s</strong>, the fastest possible speed in nature.</p>
        <p>Light is a <strong>transverse</strong> wave: vibrations are at right angles to the direction of energy transfer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Crest</strong> &mdash; highest point of the wave.</li>
          <li><strong>Trough</strong> &mdash; lowest point.</li>
          <li><strong>Wavelength</strong> &mdash; distance from crest to crest (or trough to trough).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Amplitude</strong> &mdash; relates to brightness; higher amplitude means brighter light.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency</strong> &mdash; for visible light, this sets the colour (red at low frequency, violet at high frequency).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Light can be transmitted, reflected, or absorbed.</p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>When light reflects, it obeys the <strong>law of reflection</strong>: angle of incidence = angle of reflection, both measured from the normal (a line at 90&deg; to the surface).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Specular reflection</strong> &mdash; from a smooth surface like a mirror; rays reflect in an orderly way and form a clear image.</li>
          <li><strong>Diffuse reflection</strong> &mdash; from a rough surface; rays scatter and no clear image forms.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Refraction and rainbows</h4>
        <p><strong>Refraction</strong> is the bending of light when it changes medium and speed. Going from air to water, light slows down and bends towards the normal; going from water to air, it speeds up and bends away.</p>
        <p>Rainbows are formed when sunlight enters raindrops, is refracted, reflected inside, and refracted again on the way out. Different colours bend by different amounts because they have different frequencies: red bends least, violet most.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Lenses: Focusing Light</h3>
        <p>A <strong>lens</strong> is a curved, transparent material that refracts light, often to bring rays together or spread them apart.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Convex lenses</strong> bend light rays towards each other so they meet at a focus.</li>
          <li><strong>Concave lenses</strong> spread light rays out, making a smaller, upright virtual image.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because a convex lens bends rays so they meet, objects within its focal length appear larger, upright, and magnified &mdash; this is how a magnifying glass works.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Electricity &amp; Circuits: Wired for Power</h3>
        <p>Electricity is the flow of <strong>charged particles</strong>, usually electrons, through a conductor. Electrons are tiny, negatively charged particles with almost no mass.</p>
        <h4>Current</h4>
        <p><strong>Electric current</strong> is the flow of charge. In a simple circuit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>battery</strong> transfers chemical energy to electrical energy.</li>
          <li><strong>Conducting wires</strong> provide a complete path (circuit) for electrons to flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Current is measured in amperes (A) using an <strong>ammeter</strong>. In a series circuit, the current is the same at all points.</p>
        <h4>Voltage (potential difference)</h4>
        <p><strong>Voltage</strong> is the difference in electrical energy between two points in a circuit. The bigger the voltage, the more energy each coulomb of charge carries. It is measured in volts (V) using a <strong>voltmeter</strong> in parallel.</p>
        <p>Ohm&rsquo;s Law links voltage, current, and resistance:</p>
        <p><strong>V = I &times; R</strong></p>
        <h4>Resistance</h4>
        <p><strong>Resistance</strong> measures how hard it is for current to flow and is measured in ohms (&Omega;). More resistance means less current for the same voltage.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Components like lamps and resistors add resistance.</li>
          <li>Even wires have a small resistance, often ignored in basic circuits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using <strong>R = V &divide; I</strong>, you can calculate resistance if you know the voltage across a component and the current through it.</p>
        <p class="small">Analogy: voltage is like water pressure, current is the flow of water, and resistance is a kink in the hose that slows the flow.</p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>How Car Batteries Work</h3>
        <p>A car battery is the heart of the car&rsquo;s electrical system. It stores <strong>chemical energy</strong> and releases it as electrical energy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you start the car, the battery powers the <strong>starter motor</strong>, which turns the engine.</li>
          <li>It also runs lights, wipers, the radio, and other electronics when needed.</li>
          <li>Once the engine is running, an <strong>alternator</strong> acts as a generator: it turns some of the engine&rsquo;s kinetic energy back into electrical energy to recharge the battery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall energy changes look like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chemical energy &rarr; electrical energy &rarr; car components</li>
          <li>Kinetic energy (engine) &rarr; electrical energy &rarr; recharging the battery</li>
        </ul>
